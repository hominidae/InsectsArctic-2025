# InsectsArctic-2025
This code is intended for the analysis of DNA Barcoding specimens collected in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut.



## InsectsArctic
[InsectsArctic](https://github.com/hominidae/InsectsArctic) is the original code written and developed during my MSc at the University of Guelph. Most of the DNA Barcoding specimens from this analysis were from 2018-2019.

## InsectsArctic_2024
[InsectsArctic_2024](https://github.com/hominidae/InsectsArctic_2024) was code developed to produce an analysis of DNA Barcoding data and producing a phylogenetic tree using MrBayes. Bayesian inference of phylogeny relies on computation to generate the most likely evolutionary pathway between genetic sequences. Rather than a brief and quick NJT generating these evolutionary links, MrBayes performs at least 2,000,000 iterations of the same calculation to arrive at a consensus for when a specific mutation or SNP occurred and thus propagated, provided the available sequences are a complete representation of the available data set. Roughly anyway, why use more words when few words do trick?

## InsectsArctic_2025
The latest code being developed now which produces an analysis of 2018-2024 DNA barcoding specimen data in the Kitikmeot region.

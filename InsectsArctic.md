# This document pertains to the [InsectsArctic](https://github.com/hominidae/InsectsArctic) repository.
InsectsArctic is the repository for code that contributed to my MSc and it contains the scripts used to process data collected by Polar Knowledge Canada and ARCBIO in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut.

These included the collection of insect specimens via Malaise trap, pitfall, pan traps, and hand collection with aspirators or nets.
